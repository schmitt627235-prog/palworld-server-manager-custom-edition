# Changelog

All notable changes to Palworld Server Manager are documented here.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Usage section — live CPU & memory monitoring.** A new **Usage** entry in the
  sidebar graphs real-time CPU and memory for every running world. View all
  running worlds together (aggregate CPU/memory line charts over time plus
  per-world comparison bars) or pick a single world from the scope selector to
  drill into its own CPU and memory graphs with current and peak stats. Usage is
  sampled across each server's full process tree, so it reflects the real
  shipping binary the launcher spawns — not just the launcher process. The
  sampler stays idle while no world is running.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Global Downloads & updates center.** Installs and server updates no longer
  live in a modal you can accidentally lose. A permanent **Downloads** entry in
  the sidebar shows a live count and progress while work runs, and opens a full
  Downloads page listing every active job — with per-job progress bars, phase
  labels, and expandable SteamCMD logs — plus a history of completed and failed
  runs. World updates are now tracked jobs too, so an update finally shows real
  progress instead of a silent spinner.

### Fixed
- **SteamCMD "exited with code 7" no longer fails good installs.** SteamCMD very
  often exits non-zero after a fully successful run (most often when it updates
  itself mid-run and re-execs). Success is now judged by the install on disk
  (the server binary plus a readable build id), with an automatic single retry
  for the self-update case, instead of trusting the exit code alone.
- **Progress bar no longer sticks at 100% mid-update.** SteamCMD reports the
  bootstrapper self-update and the actual multi-GB server download in two
  different formats; only the first was understood, so the bar froze at 100%
  while the real download ran invisibly. Both formats are now parsed, the bar
  resets between phases, and each phase is labelled (Updating SteamCMD →
  Downloading server files → Verifying → Installing).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **App version + update check in the sidebar.** The footer now shows the app
  name and version (replacing the old "Admin / local" placeholder). The app checks
  its GitHub releases and, when a newer version is published, shows an "Update
  available" button that opens the latest release page to download the new build.
- **Full UE4SS support** for Lua mods (the kind most Palworld mods on Nexus use),
  managed separately from Steam Workshop mods in the Mods tab:
  - Install UE4SS into a world from a user-provided release zip; the app extracts it
    into `Pal\Binaries\Win64` and forces `GuiConsoleVisible=0` (a visible console
    crashes a dedicated server on launch).
  - Detect whether UE4SS is installed and whether its console setting is server-safe,
    with a one-click fix.
  - Import, enable/disable (via `mods.txt` + `enabled.txt`), and remove Lua mods.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Change a world's install folder** from the Admin tab. Point a world at the
  correct `PalServer` folder on any drive without removing and re-adding it — the
  new path is validated as a real Palworld install, and mods, saves, and settings
  are then read from the right place. The world must be stopped to change it.
- **"Send test" button** for Discord notifications in Settings. Sends a test
  message to the entered webhook URL (before saving) and reports whether Discord
  accepted it, so you can verify the webhook without having to start or stop a
  world.

### Fixed
- **Build version now shows correctly** in the world list and on the world page
  instead of always displaying "—". Adopted Steam installs and worlds that
  missed capture at install time now have their build detected automatically,
  with a fallback to the running server's game version.
